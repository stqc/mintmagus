The legend of the Fantom Zombies began with the Fantom Marines.</p>
                <p>Fantom Zombie is an undead collection of 1031 interactively created zombie art that exists in perpetuity throughout the Fantom block chainâ€™s undead. Each Zombie is not only unique, but it also provides its owner with unique opportunities in the future.</p>
                <p>Everyone has heard of fictional zombies, but few are aware of the truth about Fantom Zombies. Many people, both in the Crypto space and elsewhere, believe in the existence of zombies. They are more than just a form of art; they must be taken seriously. Magic and witchcraft are widely accepted in Crypto space and among the Fantom Marines, and are frequently practiced as religions in a mythological wasteland.</p>
